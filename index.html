        <h2>What are fountain pens?</h2>

        <p>Fountain pens are a type of writing instrument that uses a metal nib to apply liquid ink to paper. They work by managing the flow of ink to the nib using a filter, and as ink is used, it creates a pressure inside of the ink reservoir, which helps push the ink to the nib. </p>
        <h2>Parts of a fountain pen</h2>
        <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/pages/anatomy-of-a-fountain-pen"><img src="https://imgur.com/848GV5K" width="420" height="310"/></a>
        <p>A fountain pen usually consists of a metal nib, a plastic feed, a converter/ink reservoir,  a section, a cap, and a barrel. <br>The nib is the part that lays ink to the paper, and can be made of steel, gold, platinum, or rhodium. The material that the nib is made of can have a great impact on its price. <br>The feed is a plastic unit that helps the right amount of ink to flow from the ink reservoir to the nib.<br>The converter/ink reservoir is the part that holds the ink. The <a href="http://platinumpenusa.com/luxury-writing/3776-collection/">fountain pen</a> in the picture above features a converter, which is a type of ink reservoir used to allow people to use bottled ink with a cartrige pen. This type of pen tends to be the most affordable.<br>The section is the part of the pen that holds all of the previously mentioned parts together, and also serves as the grip for the fountain pen.<br>The barrel of the fountain pen is the longer part of the main body which houses the ink reservoir.<br>The cap of the fountain pen is well, the cap</p>
        <h2>My Favorite Fountain Pens</h2>
        <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-metropolitan-fountain-pens"><img src="https://imgur.com/jO6XisK" width="300" height="200"/></a>
        <p>This is the Pilot Metropolitan, which was the first ever fointain pen I ever bought.It is a cartrige/converter pen, and has a steel nib that is on the thinner side.</p>
        <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/products/platinum-3776-century-fountain-pen-laurel-green"><img src="https://imgur.com/NJvF3AB" width="300" height="200"/></a>
        <p>This is the Platinum 3776 Century. It is named after the height of Mt. Fuji, and was the first gold nib fountain pen I ever got. It is also a cartrige/converter pen, and features a unique slip-n-seal mechanism in the cap that keeps the nib from drying out for up to 2 years.</p>
        <a href="https://www.lamy.com/en/lamy-2000/"><img src="https://imgur.com/rT1kpLb" width="300" height="200"/></a>
        <p>This is the Lamy 2000, which is currently my favorite fountain pen overall. It has a golden hooded nib, which prevents the nib from drying out when left uncapped. It is also a piston filler pen, which means that unlike the cartrige/converter pens, the ink filling mechanism is built into the barrel of the pen, giving it a much larger ink capacity.</p>
